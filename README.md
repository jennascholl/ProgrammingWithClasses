# Overview

This project is a series of desktop games built to demonstrate fundamental knowledge of programming with classes.

This project was made with the intent of expanding my capabilities as a software engineer by familiarizing myself with the use of classes in C#. I wanted to create games that were fun while challenging my current limits as a developer.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code for the development of these programs.

The code is written in C# and uses the Raylib programming library.
